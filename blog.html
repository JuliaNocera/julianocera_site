          <p class="blog">... p5.js<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;What a wondrous place the internet can be. A friend of mine introduced me to this very cool javascript library that is made for artists who like to code, or coders who like to art. While i haven’t had a chance to dig into the inner workings of the library yet, I have checked out several projects created with p5.js. In this post I will be discussing the idea behind the language.<br>
        <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;When you navigate to their home page you are greeted by a completely surprising and wonderfully exciting ‘auto-draw’ program that follows your mouse around the page creating delicious lines: thick, thin and dotted with flowing style and color. Ok, I’m already hooked and i haven’t made it passed the home page.<br>
        <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Heading over to their community statement page is another fantastic treat. The message begins with a desire to create art & design with technology. Then follows a killer message about who the community represents : <br><br><em class="quote"> 'We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.' </em><br>
        <br></p>
        <p class="blog2">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Ok so now i have seen one project (the home page) and visited their community page and all i can say is YES. Being that they are a community of learners, they have put time into their tutorials. They have an intro vid that discusses what this library is and how you might use it, followed by a series of lessons that take you from getting started to adding libraries to using node.js and socket.io to get live!<br>
        <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;In my next post on p5.js I will dig into some of the tutorials and discuss projects using this great library. For now, here is a <a class="link" href="http://p5js.org/">link</a> for you to check them out on your own, enjoy!<br><br><br>
