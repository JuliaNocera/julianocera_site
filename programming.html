          <p class="aboutMe"> ... currently i work at Rexel making apps for ecommerce. I attend local meeetups and work on side projects as well. Right now I am starting an app to expirement with Google voice and translations. A while ago I went to <em>Hack Reactor</em> to deepen my understanding of javascript and gain project based experience.This was such a great opportunity to get into the coding world and I have found myself completely falling into place. I found my work home and I love the challenges this industry provides. I love working on hard things with good people and I can't wait to just keep challenging myself.<br><br>You can view my <a class="link" href="resume.html" target="_blank">resume here</a> or find my projects on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/julianocera" target="_blank">github</a>.
